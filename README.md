LAB2 iterative systems, Naiara Garmendia 241674

In this lab, we have to create a game where a machine shoots hays and destroy the sheeps. For that we have to follow the class power point and then we also have some links with the tutorial. 
In my case, I try to follow all the steps, but at first, every time I press the botton play, I could only see the start and quit button but I could not press them. So I decided to delete them. Then I followed all the steps, but when I get to the part where I need to press the bottoms and change the machine colour, I could not do it since before having the oportunity to press the buttoms the game already started. And also, since I delated them in the first step, the first camera view is not as it has to be. 
Another thing that I need to fix is that when the sheep drops, it counts like two sheeps droped, but I have been cheking all the scrips and I can't find where I have the error.
